Named description for markers using InfoWindow probably

Minimize unwanted street views

Add additional street views not part of directions

Support for different modes other than driving. Should be easy but not really as important.

Support for waypoints e.g. 19 Scanlan st Bentleigh East -> Southland Shopping Centre -> Moorabbin Railway station
Can almost reproduce this as two separate trips e.g. Scanlan st -> Southland and Southland -> Moorabbin

Drop markers animation

Select different routes as there will be multiple or automatically select one only


#########################################
## Improvements on basic functionality ##
#########################################


Use distance information in steps and include this in the UI e.g. [Turn left into brown street] [Drive 5km]

Starting street view direction heading guess from locations

Vertical and Horizontal layouts based on Google map direction for direction and match it.

Left and right direction detection and matching.

Top and bottom start direction detection and matching.

Scrollable streetviews horizontally if they, as is probable, have too many to display without scrolling.

Link streetview with map while adjusting view. Only want one at a time.

Reset to default path after dragging line as the dragging can leave the line in strange state
