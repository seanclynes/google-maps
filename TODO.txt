Resizable boundary between maps and streetview

Named description for markers using InfoWindow probably

Add additional street views not part of directions

Support for different modes other than driving. Should be easy but not really as important.

Support for waypoints e.g. 19 Scanlan st Bentleigh East -> Southland Shopping Centre -> Moorabbin Railway station
Can almost reproduce this as two separate trips e.g. Scanlan st -> Southland and Southland -> Moorabbin

Drop markers animation

Select different routes as there will be multiple or automatically select one only

Investigate and possibly use steps within step for heading as it will be a little more accurate

Can I detect no street view coverage for marker? Use StreetViewService


#########################################
## Improvements on basic functionality ##
#########################################


Use distance information in steps and include this in the UI e.g. [Turn left into brown street] [Drive 5km]

Vertical and Horizontal layouts based on Google map direction for direction and match it.

Left and right direction detection and matching.

Top and bottom start direction detection and matching.

Scrollable streetviews horizontally if they, as is probable, have too many to display without scrolling.

Link streetview with map while adjusting view. Only want one at a time.

Reset to default path after dragging line as the dragging can leave the line in strange state

The ability to minimize unwanted streetviews
  * clickable icon for each streetview description
  * animation to gradually decrease te height of the streetview then hide it completely.
  * icon change when hidden
  * animation to gradually show streetview
  * written in a way that will make saving the state easy in the future. Don't implement yet.

    Prototype for animation streetview hide/show
    o Add class using DOM functions
    o Add animation class using DOM functions
    o Listen for animation end event and change styling of description and javascript state

improve CSS and in particular flex box usage. Mobile friendly layout
