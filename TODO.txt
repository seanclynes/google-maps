Resizable boundary between maps and streetview

Named description for markers using InfoWindow probably

Add additional street views not part of directions
Support for waypoints e.g. 19 Scanlan st Bentleigh East -> Southland Shopping Centre -> Moorabbin Railway station

Support for different modes other than driving. Should be easy but not really as important.

Drop markers animation

Select different routes as there will be multiple or automatically select one only

Investigate and possibly use steps within step for heading as it will be a little more accurate

Can I detect no street view coverage for marker? Use StreetViewService

Reset to default path after dragging line as the dragging can leave the line in strange state

## Improvements on basic functionality ##
#########################################


Use distance information in steps and include this in the UI e.g. [Turn left into brown street] [Drive 5km]

Link streetview with map while adjusting view. Only want one at a time.
