Should templating be replaced with something like AngularJS/Mustache wrapping maps/streetviews?
Possibly very large or very hard

safari vertical line in streetview

Resizable boundary between maps and streetview

Named description for markers using InfoWindow probably

Investigate and possibly use steps within step for heading as it will be a little more accurate

Can I detect no street view coverage for marker? Use StreetViewService

Reset to default path after dragging line as the dragging can leave the line in strange state

Save state, very large/new project, so that you can manipulate a turn-by-turn trip again and on another device.

## Improvements on basic functionality ##
#########################################


Better spacing or remove the search field from the map so that markers aren't hidden by inputs.

Add additional street views not part of directions
Support for waypoints e.g. 19 Scanlan st Bentleigh East -> Southland Shopping Centre -> Moorabbin Railway station

Support for different modes other than driving. Should be easy but not really as important.

Ability to link to directions probably with just encoded places as url parameters.

proper top level domain trippreview.seanclynes.com or seanclynes.com/trippreview.html

limit my key usage to top level domain i.e. seanclynes.com

export to github

Investigation of use of Mustaches to replace templating code.
  * Factor out response parsing code and do all of it upfront
  * Replace DOM code and additional templates with {{}}

Simplify and organize Javascript as much as possible. Use of "And" in function names is probably bogus, should b 2 calls
Also the code should follow the business functionality which in this case is the UI so..
  * Streetview
    * description
    * streetview
  * Route info
  * map
  * messages
  * general/utility
