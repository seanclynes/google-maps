Commit c4c894f80505fc1d175889a2ae26c7475721c7a3 is mostly working for firefox checked radio

Working intermittantly with multiple_routes branch but at times very broken
commit a401d6d9afbe9ace4c2739479da097d942d83732

Works almost 100% the first time after page reload in new tab. 10+ times in a row

Breaks almost 100% when I click another radio button and stays broken.

Works almost 100% when you click the first radio and it redraws the streetview.
i.e. it doesn't cause it to enter broken state.
